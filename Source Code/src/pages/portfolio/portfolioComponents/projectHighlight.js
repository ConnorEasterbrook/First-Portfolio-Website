The tool is designed to be accessible for external use and uses computational geometry to decompose complex meshes into individual triangles, rendering the new textures correctly. The modular design and multi-threading ensure that the tool is highly efficient, with fast computation times, even for complex meshes. \n . \n This project was created within a 5 week time span while studying Games Technology at UWE Bristol, for the Advanced Technologies module.The project has been analysed from both a commercial viability perspective as a game asset.",
